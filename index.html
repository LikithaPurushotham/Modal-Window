      There are many health benefits of owning a pet. They can increase opportunities to exercise, get outside, and
      socialize. Regular walking or playing with pets can decrease blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and triglyceride
      levels. Pets can help manage loneliness and depression by giving us companionship. Most households in the United
      States have at least one pet.

      Studies have shown that the bond between people and their pets can increase fitness, lower stress, and bring
      happiness to their owners.It‚Äôs incredible just how much support an animal can bring to your life. As
      MyPetNeedsThat mentions, if you are particularly vulnerable or have special needs then there are certain dog
      breeds that are perfect at providing emotional and physical support. A dog or cat can help with loneliness, give
      you companionship and someone to talk to, and sit with you during the evenings. Pets can be lifesavers when it
      comes to depression and grief. They can give you a sense of purpose and a reason to get out of bed when you are
      feeling particularly depressed or anxious. Animals such as cats and dogs can have a deeply calming effect on
      humans and can often pick up on their owner‚Äôs moods: snuggling up to you when you are feeling sad or licking your
      hands if they sense that you have anxiety.
